# HackRU Sponsorship Portal (for the deprecated sourcecode)

- The frontend code has largely been pulled from the HackRU/frontend repo and then modified. 
## Links to Further Docs (some shit I read when starting out)

*I will be updating this section anytime I find something useful*, so think of this less as a "required reading list" and more of a "resource reference."
But please **do read** the docs on [contributing to this project](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and [on our transition to Redux](./ROAD_TO_REDUX.md).
If you don't read those, you may easily run into issues.
