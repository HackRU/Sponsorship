                                    "Built from the ground up, HackRU was the first hackathon to express the true essence of flavor. Capturing the natural characteristics of only the finest ingredients, HackRU is exceptional in taste - thanks to the personal commitment of the sponsors and organizers."

                                    "HackRU Spring 2018 was a really fun and exciting experience - from food to workshops to speakers, the venue really had everything! But aside from all that, it was also a really great experience to just sit down and learn with other people, regardless of whether they were my friends or not. While I wasn't able to finish my project, I was really happy that I learned something valuable at the end of the day."
